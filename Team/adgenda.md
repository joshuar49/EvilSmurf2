# Team Adgenda

## Meet Up 01

#### Today's Tasks

##### Environment Set Up

1. **Download and update a Debian based distro**
    - Kali, Ubuntu, Debian, Raspbian
2. **Downloading the pi.sh shell script**
    - This will involve the dependencies as well
    - Moving the binary files to the right directory for the bluetooth receiver
    - Compiling the programs and running them
3. **Passing on another raspberry pi for three people to develop at the same time?**
##### Getting Everyone On The Same Page
- Maybe rereading the sponsor document for more clarification
- How can we start to mitigate these vulnerabilities?
- Maybe more research on which bluetooth vulnerabilities are more dangerous?
- Assigning what taskas we should take
- New topics to learn? (Markdown, git, C, Wireshark)
- What should we demo to the SME
- Schedule dates that are good for us to meet up (in person or virtually)

##### Questions, Suggestions?
